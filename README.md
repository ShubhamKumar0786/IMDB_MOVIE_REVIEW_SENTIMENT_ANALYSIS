# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the    IMDB dataset and deployed as a web application using Streamlit for user interaction.

## Project Overview
The project consists of:

- A Jupyter notebook (`simplernn.ipynb`) for training and evaluating the Simple RNN model.  
- A Streamlit application (`main.py`) for classifying user-provided movie reviews.  
- A pre-trained model file (`simple_rnn_imdb.h5`) for sentiment prediction.  
- A requirements file (`requirements.txt`) listing the necessary Python libraries.

The model processes movie reviews by converting them into numerical sequences, padding them to a fixed length, and predicting sentiment using a trained Simple RNN. The Streamlit app allows users to input a movie review and receive a sentiment prediction (Positive or Negative) along with a confidence score.

### Files in the Repository

- `simplernn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code to load the IMDB dataset, preprocess the data, train the Simple RNN model, and save the trained model as `simple_rnn_imdb.h5`.
- `main.py`: Python script for the Streamlit web application that loads the pre-trained model and allows users to input movie reviews for sentiment classification.
- `simple_rnn_imdb.h5`: Pre-trained Simple RNN model file used for sentiment prediction in the Streamlit app.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries and their versions for running the project.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.11 or compatible version  
- A virtual environment (recommended)  
- The libraries listed in `requirements.txt`  

### Setup Instructions

**Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

**Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Download the Pre-trained Model:**  
Ensure the `simple_rnn_imdb.h5` file is present in the project directory. This file is required for the Streamlit app to make predictions.

## Running the Streamlit App Locally
To launch the Streamlit application locally:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

- Open the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501) in your web browser.
- Enter a movie review in the text area.
- Click the "Classify" button to see the predicted sentiment (Positive or Negative) and the prediction score.

## Deploying to Streamlit Cloud
The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud, accessible at:  
ðŸ”— https://imdbmoviereviewsentimentanalysis0786.streamlit.app/

To deploy your own version of the app to Streamlit Cloud:

### Push the Repository to GitHub:
Ensure your project is hosted on a public GitHub repository, including `main.py`, `simple_rnn_imdb.h5`, and `requirements.txt`.

### Sign Up for Streamlit Cloud:

- Visit Streamlit Cloud and sign up using your GitHub account.
- Request access if needed (Streamlit Cloud may require an invitation for free-tier access).

### Deploy the App:

- Log in to Streamlit Cloud and click "New app" on the dashboard.
- Select your GitHub repository, branch, and specify `main.py` as the main script.
- Ensure `requirements.txt` is in the repository root to install dependencies automatically.
- Click "Deploy!" to build and deploy the app.
- Once deployed, Streamlit Cloud provides a unique URL for your app.

### Verify Deployment:

- Check the deployed app at the provided URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`).
- Ensure the `simple_rnn_imdb.h5` file is correctly referenced in `main.py` and accessible in the repository.

> **Note:** Streamlit Cloud requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser to run the app. Ensure the model file (`simple_rnn_imdb.h5`) is included in the repository, as it is essential for predictions.

## Training the Model

To retrain the model, open `simplernn.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

**Install Jupyter if not already installed:**
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

**Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `simplernn.ipynb` and run all cells to preprocess the IMDB dataset, train the Simple RNN model, and save it as `simple_rnn_imdb.h5`.

## Model Details

- **Dataset**: IMDB movie review dataset from TensorFlow/Keras, with a vocabulary size of 10,000 words.
- **Preprocessing**: Reviews are converted to numerical sequences, padded/truncated to a length of 500 words.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Embedding layer (10,000 vocab size, 128-dimensional embeddings)
  - Simple RNN layer (128 units, ReLU activation)
  - Dense layer (1 unit, sigmoid activation for binary classification)

- **Training**:
  - Optimizer: Adam  
  - Loss: Binary Crossentropy  
  - Metrics: Accuracy  
  - Early Stopping: Monitors validation loss with a patience of 5 epochs

- **Output**: The model outputs a score between 0 and 1, where:
  - >0.5 indicates a **positive** sentiment
  - â‰¤0.5 indicates a **negative** sentiment

## Example Usage

**Input a Review:**
```
"This movie was absolutely fantastic! The acting was superb, and the plot kept me engaged throughout."
```
**Output:**  
Sentiment: **Positive**, Prediction Score: ~0.85

**Input a Review:**
```
"The movie was boring and poorly acted. I wouldn't recommend it."
```
**Output:**  
Sentiment: **Negative**, Prediction Score: ~0.32

## Notes

- The `simple_rnn_imdb.h5` file is essential for the Streamlit app. Ensure it is not deleted or moved.
- The model may not handle very short reviews or reviews with out-of-vocabulary words optimally due to the preprocessing steps.
- For better performance, consider experimenting with LSTM or GRU layers instead of Simple RNN, or fine-tuning hyperparameters.
